##  How It's Made:

Tech: CSS, HTML

Responsive mock site of a pokemon gym's services.

## Optimizations

I used media queries to improve the site's responsiveness at difference screen sizes.

## Potential Future Optimizations

In the future, I could make the links clickable and have them change color when hovered over. However, this was just a practice site to polish my media query (responsiveness) and fluidity skills so I do not plan to make these changes at this time.

Similarly, I added a main.js file in case I wanted to add JavaScript later. However it is blank at the moment as I did not need it for this project. 

## Lessons Learned

I learned about hosting a site on github. I initially added a .nojekyll file as some individuals who had the same issues as me found it fixed their problem. However, as I read more about .nojekyll I realized its only needed if files begin with _, as jekyll will discard them. 

Discovered margin: 0 auto only works if it has a display value of block, is not floated, and must have a declared width.
